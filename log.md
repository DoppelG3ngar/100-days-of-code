# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 1st, 2020 

**Today's Progress:**
Today I've been working on my tribute page. I'll be planning and filling out the project and hopefully fully complete it this weekend. 

**Thoughts:**
Today I will be committing to the challenge while I work towards filling out my gaps as a developer. I'll be starting with the projects listed on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). I've already started the tribute page and I'll begin the survey form.

### Day 1: Jan 2nd, 2020 

**Today's Progress:**
Today I added the ability to change the track list based on which album you clicked and started working on the about section.

**Thoughts:**
Planning what to write in the sections is coming pretty slow to me. I think I'll try to round up the tribute project tomorrow so I can move to the next project.
